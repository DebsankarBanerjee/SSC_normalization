# SSC_normalization
**Here is an example of the normalization scheme used by SSC in CGL, CHSL and other exams.** \
The mathematical process was taken from 
the [publicly available document](https://ssc.nic.in/SSCFileServer/PortalManagement/UploadedFiles/NormalizationFormulaforSSC_07022019.pdf) and the **author
of this repository is not responsible for any mistakes in the codes published here**.\
The example was built upon many assumptions as stated in the code. Hope this calculations may help someone who wants to study this with better real life data.
